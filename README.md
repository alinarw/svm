# Support Vector Machines

Using the Support Vector Machine to perform classiÔ¨Åcation on MNIST data set. The SVM model was learned and computed the accuracy of prediction with respect to training, validation and testing datasets using the following parameters:
1. Linear kernel
2. Radial basis function with value of gamma setting to 1 Using radial basis function with value of gamma setting to default
3. Radial basis function with value of gamma setting to default and varying value of C (1, 10, 20, 30 ,, 100)
As a result, a graph of accuracy with respect to values of C was plotted.

#### Tools & Liblaries: Python, Numpy, Scipy, Sklearn
